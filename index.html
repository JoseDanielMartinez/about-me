    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Jose Daniel Martinez (he/him) and I’m joining class from Miami, FL 
      here on the East Coast. Just retired from the military after a 20 plus year career. As a career 
      Infantryman, have little tech background experience beyond calling the IT guys. Recently 
      completed Code Fellows’ 102 intro course so have a basic developer understanding but I’m ready 
      for more. I’m excited about the course because after just completing 102, there’s a 
       lot more to learn so I’m up for the challenge. Goals include learning as much as possible, 
       working with all my classmates, and scoring a 100 percent on the final.
